    <h1>Weezer</h1>

    <p>This is one of my favorite songs and the lyrics "Say It Ain't So"

        Oh yeah
        Alright
        
        Somebody's Heine'
        Is crowdin' my icebox
        Somebody's cold one
        Is givin' me chills
        Guess I'll just close my eyes
        
        Oh yeah
        Alright
        Feels good
        Inside
        
        Flip on the tele
        Wrestle with Jimmy
        Something is bubbling
        Behind my back
        The bottle is ready to blow
        
        Say it ain't so
        Your drug is a heart-breaker
        Say it ain't so
        My love is a life-taker
        
        I can't confront you
        I never could do
        That which might hurt you
        So try and be cool
        When I say
        This way is a water-slide away from me
        That takes you further every day
        So be cool
        
        Say it ain't so
        Your drug is a heart-breaker
        Say it ain't so
        My love is a life-taker
        
        Dear Daddy
        I write you in spite of years of silence
        You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear
        This bottle of Stephen's awakens ancient feelings
        Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood
        Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
        
        Say it ain't so
        Your drug is a heart-breaker
        Say it ain't so
        My love is a life-taker
      
    </p>
